#Github User Search

A React.js app I built to help me solidify the things I've learnt so far in React.js.
This app allows you to search and view Github users and their repos via their usernames.

It connects and gets all it's data from the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/)
Live app is hosted [here](https://themmanuel.github.io/Github-Search/)

<!-- Live app hosted [here]()  -->

**Main Technologes Used:**
- React.js
- Axios
- React Router 
- Moment.js

**Here are some of the things I learnt**
- Fetching HTTP requests using the Axios package and Javascript promises
- Routing in React by using the React Router package
- React hooks, (useState, useEffect and useReducer)
- State management with useState and useReducer
- Passing data between components with props.
- Deploying a react app to a live server
- Most importantly, building this project also helped me plan out an app from ideation to fruition
